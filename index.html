          <b>Lombok</b>
          <p>Some people might call Lombok as the sister island of Bali, but they might not told you about who the bigger sister is. Here is the place where the gems are rarely touched and the beaches are barely stepped. The landscapes and the people are all familiar, yet shows a different, quieter   shade than its lively sister. But the first and foremost, Lombok is surfer’s paradise.

            It’s about fun in the sun, but it’s also about tradition. Lombok’s culture might not be as populated with artists and craftsmen as Bali, but in no way that means it’s not as beautiful. You can witness the ancient wisdom of traditional potteries, artistic weaving, peculiar houses, and so much more. When you talk about the Lombok Tours, you’re talking about one meaningful experience in one serene island.</p>

          <b>Toraja</b>
          <p>When we talk about someone passing away, we might grieve and feel a heavy load on our backs. But not the Torajans. Here, they celebrate it as a part of life. Even as far as still communicating, giving meals, and taking picture with the remains. They even give them their own home, with all the luxury that it demands.

            That is a big part of the Torajans’ life, and it does not stop there. The Torajan Tribe is rich with admirable traditions that can transform your way of looking at life. Every dance, every sheet of weaving, every house has meaning and value to the life of the tribe. When you talk about the Torajans and the Toraja Tours, you’re talking about appreciating life in a much deeper level.</p>

          <b>Yogyakarta</b>
          <p>If you ever wonder how living in a kingdom feels like, Yogyakarta is a place for it. As one of the few places in Indonesia that still has a monarch ruler, Yogyakarta is a metropolis that is also a reminiscent of the Southeast Asia’s Hindu Kingdoms Era. Gone are the days, but all the historical palaces, heritage, and culture are all still there.

            And yet, braving into Yogyakarta has an adventurous side to it. Just North of the city is the sumptuous Mt. Merapi, where the wildest mountain adventures you can think of could come true. Go West, and you'll find the Borobudur Temple, one of the most magnificent relics of the Buddhist Kingdoms. Just the sight of it will open your eyes regarding the wisdom and the way of life of our Buddhists.
            
            You will never miss the sight of a modern city, either. For it is one of the best cities for hangouts and relaxations. Feel free to experience an array of modern attractions such as cafes, art spaces, and golfing. One thing’s for sure, whichever one it is, nothing will let you down in Yogyakarta Tours.</p>
